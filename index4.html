          <h1>Features of French language</h1>
          <p1>1. The type of Latin French descended from is not the same as traditional Latin? It’s called Vulgar (nonstandard) Latin. Vulgar Latin was essentially informal Latin, whereas traditional Latin is what scholars and academics tend to study. All of the Romance languages are descended from Vulgar Latin.  </p1>

          <p2>2. L’Académie Française Protects the Language
          The literary integrity of the French language has been preserved by the Académie Française since its creation in 1634 by Cardinal Richelieu. The Academy consists of 40 members who oversee the language, adding new words and contemplating changes to modernize the language. Many languages have similar types of academies, except for English.
          The Academy recently announced there would be significant changes in the French language in 2016. They voted to remove the use of the circumflex over both the “i” and “u,” changing the spelling of many words. They also voted to change the spellings of some words like “oignon” to “ognon”, which means “onion”. They believe removing some silent letters will make it easier to learn the language.</p2>

          <p3>3. French Popularity is Increasing
          Since the end of World War 2, the number of French speakers has tripled. Interestingly enough, the language’s popularity continues to increase as French-speaking countries in Africa continue to grow and develop. Current projections show that the population of French speakers around the world could increase to over 750 million by 2050. This number isn’t too surprising when you take into account that there are currently 500,000 French teachers instructing over 120 million students worldwide.</p3>

          <p4>4. French Wasn’t Popular in France
          This is probably the strangest of these French language facts. The French language wasn’t widely used across France until after the French Revolution. Before this period, France had pockets where various dialects were used. In fact, until the 19th Century, French was used more in Germany and Holland</p4>

          <p5>5. 29% of English Vocabulary Comes From French
          English is indeed a collage of other languages. And while it shares strong similarities to German, its French influence cannot be denied. This is a result of the Norman Conquest of England in 1066 A.D. This invasion resulted in a lengthy infusion of the two languages. Presently, roughly 50.000 English words come from French. In addition to this influence, there are many modern French loanwords in English as well. A few examples of these are “café,” “déjà vu,” “décor,” “naïve,” and “restaurant.”</p5>

          <p6>6. Counting in French Has a Different Logic
          Every language approaches counting in their own, unique way, but with French, it can be seen as strange at times. Nowhere is clearer than between the numbers 80 and 99. While in English you would say “eighty-three,” in French, you would say, “quatre-vingt” or “four twenties. It gets really interesting when you reach 99. Instead of saying, ninety-nine, you would say, “quatre-vingt-dix-neuf” or “four twenties, ten, nine.”
          This partial vigesimal system or system of counting by twenty came about after the French Revolution as a way of unifying the counting system. </p6>
