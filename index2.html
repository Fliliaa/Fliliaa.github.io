            <h1>French language</h1>
            <p>French is probably the most internationally significant Romance language in the world. It is a main or official language not just in France also in parts of Belgium and Switzerland, in Monaco, in parts of Canada, in north and West Africa, Lebanon, and parts of South-East Asia, particularly in former French colonies. It is an official or a main second language in 55 countries worldwide, and is reputed to be the foreign language that is most widely used in international communications, after English. Almost 300 million people speak French as their native language or as a second language.</p>
